        I currently work with the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. My current duties are assisting our blind and low vision users with software and hardware recommendations, this is to ensure that they can complete their job effectively. I install and help with the initial setup of JAWS, Zoomtext, Dragon, Duxbury, Kurzweil, and NVDA. I have helped update and maintain the Division’s Intranet page and have also ensured that it is accessible to screen readers. I ensure that all HR documents to include but not limited to; policies, procedures and desk aids, are accessible to all of our staff. I am the purchasing agent for my team and work within a procurement application(CORE)to ensure that all of our software licensing is up to date and that all end of life equipment is replaced. I have also been in charge of helping migrate off of end of life servers (Windows Server 2008 r2) to our “cloud” solution. During this transition we are getting AD updated to have all user drive mappings ran with group policy instead of having scripts run at login.</p>
